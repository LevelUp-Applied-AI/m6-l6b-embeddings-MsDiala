# Lab 6B — Embeddings Comparison

Compare three text representation methods — TF-IDF, GloVe, and DistilBERT — on a corpus of climate articles.

## Objectives

- Build TF-IDF representations and compute pairwise document similarity
- Load pre-trained GloVe vectors and compute average text embeddings
- Extract contextual embeddings from DistilBERT using the Hugging Face transformers library
- Compare similarity rankings across all three methods

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

DistilBERT runs on PyTorch; we install the CPU wheel explicitly so the download stays small. `requirements.txt` intentionally omits `torch`.

**Note:** The first time you import DistilBERT, the model (~250MB) will be downloaded and cached. This may take a few minutes on slower connections.

## Data

- `data/climate_articles.csv` — Climate article corpus
- `data/glove_5k_50d.txt` — Pre-extracted GloVe vectors (5000 words, 50 dimensions)

## Tasks

Complete all six functions in `embeddings_lab.py`:

1. **`build_tfidf(texts)`** — Build TF-IDF representations using `TfidfVectorizer`
2. **`compute_tfidf_similarity(tfidf_matrix)`** — Compute pairwise cosine similarity matrix
3. **`load_glove(filepath)`** — Load GloVe vectors into a dictionary
4. **`text_to_glove(text, embeddings)`** — Compute average GloVe embedding for a text
5. **`extract_bert_embedding(text, tokenizer, model)`** — Extract a DistilBERT sentence embedding
6. **`compare_similarities(texts, queries, ...)`** — Compare top-3 similar texts across all methods

## Submission

1. Create a branch named `lab-6b-embeddings`
2. Complete all functions in `embeddings_lab.py`
3. Run `pytest tests/ -v` to verify your work
4. Open a PR to `main` — the autograder will run automatically
5. Your PR description must include:
   - Comparison table for 5 queries: top-3 similar texts per method
   - Analysis: where methods agree/disagree
   - Paste your PR URL into TalentLMS → Module 6 Week B → Lab 6B to submit this assignment

Resubmissions are accepted through Saturday of the assignment week.
